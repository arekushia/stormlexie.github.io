Hello there !

Wanted to share you two new sets I just created on SoundCloud.

The sets focus on **Keith Kenniff** -Helios- music, a great artist. A blend of electronic/ambient/indierock/coolish stuff.

Perfect for work in the sunlight, naps on sweet beds or waits in a long corridor. The first one is about happiness, the second one more about calm.

Hope you like it,

Lexie.

*Addendum: I will update it sometimes, if I find something new which corresponds to the spirit of the set*
